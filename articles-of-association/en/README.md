# Preamble

As human beings, our personal health is an invaluable asset which we
will use all possible means to protect.

This effort to maintain as well as to regain and foster a state of good
health, is a challenging task which, if it is to be effective in the
long-term, must take a holistic view of the human being. It requires an
approach that is compassionate, understanding, empathetic and motivated
by a desire to protect that which is of such vital importance to each
and every one of us.

A health care system that is co-determined by the dynamics of profitable
markets - including the pursuit of growing shareholder values – can not
be expected to satisfactorily achieve that task. Such a system regularly
produces conflicts between the opposing interests of patients, doctors
and providers of medical products and services. For this reason, we need
approaches within the health system that go beyond profit-oriented
economies – approaches that are founded on good will and trust.

The increasing popularity of common good economies clearly demonstrates
that more and more people are seeing a need for living a life that is
less concerned with financial gain and more focused on helping others
and the environment.

Medicine, as a scientific discipline for the diagnosis, treatment and
prevention of illness, is necessarily based on empirical observation –
it requires evidence backed by data. However, we are still short of approaches
aiming to create a freely accessible pool of medical data that can be
used to derive useful information for both doctors and patients. In
addition, the commercial use of medical data hinders cooperation between
medical professionals and makes it harder for patients to obtain the
information they need. As a result, many opportunities for improving
health are missed.

The Open Medicine Initiative aims to activate the potential of
community-oriented individuals in order to strengthen the patients as
autonomous decision-makers in questions concerning their own health (→
patient empowerment). We are therefore seeking to combine the medical
expertise of patients and professionals by using modern data processing
techniques such that medical data can be collected, evaluated and
published in a freely accessible format. Furthermore, we will work to
ensure that the value of medical data is understood as a common good.
Through our work, we will help to create more transparency and to
support both medical professionals and patients towards a better
informed application of medical knowledge.
