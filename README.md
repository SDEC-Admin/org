###Virtual meeting of members
[Loomio](http://boingboing.net/2014/03/19/loomio-democratic-decision-ma.html) is a great, open source tool for lean management of group decision processes. Groups of people can initiate proposals, discuss them and finally vote on it. Members can easily create sub-groups for more detailed discussions and everybody can participate in any issue of her/his interest. Every member of the organization will be a member of the [open medicine group](https://www.loomio.org/g/EedHvuAr/open-medicine-e-v).
