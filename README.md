Open Medicine Association
============

Welcome to one of the public facing sites of the Open Medicine Association (OMA). The OMA was founded to support patient empowerment and ideas of open, non-profit health care services. One of its main efforts is the coordination of the development of [OpenMed](http://www.open-med.net) - an online platform built around open medical data. 

##Transparency
Transparency is a key aspect for building communities and core principle of OMA, which is why we have built it right into our article of constitution. We have committed ourselves to publish any relevant document related to our activities: protocols of meetings of members or senat, regular financial statements, lists of members, and anything our members consider worth sharing.

###Virtual meeting of members
We are also trying to make group decisions of decentralized groups possible with the help of online tools. This is why we have the option of virtual meetings of members built into our article of association.

[Loomio](http://boingboing.net/2014/03/19/loomio-democratic-decision-ma.html) is a great, open source tool for lean management of group decision processes. Groups of people can initiate proposals, discuss them and finally vote on it. Members can easily create sub-groups for more detailed discussions and everybody can participate in any issue of her/his interest. Every member of the organization will be a member of the [open medicine group](https://www.loomio.org/g/EedHvuAr/open-medicine-e-v).
